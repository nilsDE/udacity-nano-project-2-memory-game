# Memory Game Project - Udacity Nanodegree Frontend Development

## What this is 

This is a Memory Game written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was part of the Udacity Nanodegree Frontend Development which I successfully completed end of 2018. 
The game was provided without any Javascript code (except the shuffle function) - HTML and CSS was given though.
The task was to add all the functionality to the game. 
The game runs in the browser. 

## Game rules

The user can always turn two cards. If they match, they stay open. If they do not match they will turn again. The goal is to detect all the matching pairs. There are eight pairs. With the first turned card the clock starts ticking and it will stop if the user has found the last pair. Stars are being awarded. Under 25 moves gives three stars, under 40 moves givs 2 stars, more moves one star. At the end of the game the user is told the time and the moves he needed to win and also the number of stars rewarded.

## How to use this repository

[You can play the game here!](https://nilsde.github.io/udacity-nano-project-2-memory-game/)
Ideally open in Chrome!

## TODOs

Some of the functions could be refactored into smaller chunks.
