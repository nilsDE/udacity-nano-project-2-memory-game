## Instructions

This is a Memory Game written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
No installations are necessary, the game runs in the browser.

## How it works

The user can always turn two cards. If they match, they stay open. If they do not
match they will turn again.
The goal is to detect all the matching pairs. There are eight pairs.
With the first turned card the clock starts ticking and it will stop if the user has
found the last pair. Stars are being awarded. Under 25 moves gives three stars,
under 40 moves givs 2 stars, more moves one star.
At the end of the game the user is told the time and the moves he needed to win
and also the number of stars rewarded.
